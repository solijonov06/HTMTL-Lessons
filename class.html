        <h1>
            What is Lorem Ipsum?
        </h1>
        <p class="qizil">
            Lorem Ipsum is <b>simply <i></b> text of the <i>printing and typesetting</i> industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br>  It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
        </p>
        <p class="green katta center">
            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Where does it come from?
        </h2>
        <p class="qizil katta">
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
